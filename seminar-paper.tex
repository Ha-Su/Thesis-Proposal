\noindent{\emph{Important note:}} The first deliverable (one-page summary) consists of \emph{(i)} an abstract, where important questions need to be addressed with short sentences. For instance, you should justify why the topic is important and mention what are the main contributions of the paper. In addition, the one-page summary will also have an \emph{(ii)} introduction section and \emph{(iii)} a background section. If you need to create an additional section, feel free to do it. For instance, if you have identified open problems that have not been addressed by the paper, you could create a new section to discuss these aspects (and possibly propose solutions). Finally, in the last section, you should summarize the paper you have read and show your understanding. In the \emph{references section}, include 5 (or more) relevant works in the topic (that you want to read later). \\

\emph{Be concise and clear with your explanation as the space is limited to a single page (without considering references)}.
